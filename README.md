# EVENTS-APP
Django - backend.
React JS - frontend.
This is my first app with Django & React JS.

If you are a teacher and you need to note the time you spend on your lessons, count your visits, films you show, and publications you use, - you have it in this app. You will be able to save your information for the current month and have access to the history of all your events for each month.

This App is also responsive for mobile devices such as tablets and phones.
